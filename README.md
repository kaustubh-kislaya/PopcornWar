Detailed Explaination of the Sections:
-TMDB API Setup:
To create our movie website, we first set up the TMDB API, which provides access to a vast database of movie and TV show information. Using Axios, a popular HTTP client for JavaScript, we can easily make API requests to fetch data. Before proceeding further, we perform API testing to ensure that the communication with the API is working smoothly.

-Redux Toolkit Setup:
For efficient state management, we configure Redux Toolkit, a powerful library that simplifies the management of application state in React. By defining reducers, actions, and creating a centralized store, Redux Toolkit helps us handle data changes across different components.

-React Router Setup:
With React Router, we enable seamless navigation within our movie website. It allows us to create multiple routes for different sections and pages, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

-Homepage - Hero Banner Section:
The homepage features a captivating Hero Banner Section that showcases the latest and most popular movies and TV shows. This section highlights eye-catching images and brief details of the featured titles, enticing users to explore further.

We apply CSS styling to the Hero Banner Section, ensuring that it aligns with the website's design and creates an appealing visual presentation. This step helps enhance the overall aesthetics of the website.
